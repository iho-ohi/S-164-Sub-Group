# S-164 Sub-Group.

This repository contains S-100 test datasets and the test dataset manual. It also tracks issues related directly to the development of S-164 and any impacts they have on the development of IHO S-98 as well.

As agreed by the group in discussions

* Problems with datasets in relation to S-164 are tracked here
* Issues relating to the ENC standard, S-101 will be tracked by the S-101 IHO repository
* S-98 has its own repository [here](https://github.com/iho-ohi/98-interoperability) where issues can be raised and tracked.
* Please link related issues to avoid unecessary duplication

## Looking for Test Data?
* This repository holds intermediate releases of test data and the accompanying manual. Releases are compiled whenever a group of tests are ready and documented in the manual. Releases are then available from this repository on the [releases](https://github.com/iho-ohi/S-164-Sub-Group/releases) page.
* In the interim, feel free to use datasets from the staging area. This contains datasets, keys, certificates and other items required for building the various test datasets. They are in the [staging](https://github.com/iho-ohi/S-164-Sub-Group/tree/main/data/Staging) folder. **Do not attempt to use the staging datasets for anything other than testing**. they are not authoritative until the manual is published and datasets released for testing.
* Datasets will eventually be processed into exchange sets for use in testing the manual. These are located in the [Exchange Sets](https://github.com/iho-ohi/S-164-Sub-Group/tree/main/data/ExchangeSets) area. They may be under development too, though. As the manual is finalised, the exchange sets will be re-created for use in the test scripts.
