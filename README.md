# S-164 Sub-Group

This repository contains S-100 test datasets and the test dataset manual. It also tracks issues related directly to the development of S-164 and any impacts they have on the development of IHO S-98 as well.

As agreed by the group in discussions

* Issues relating to ENC content (i.e. S-101) will be tracked by the S-101 IHO repository
* Issues relating to exchange set construction for S-164, and how tests are described in S-164 are also described here
* S-98 has its own repository [here](https://github.com/iho-ohi/98-interoperability) where issues can be raised and tracked. As most S-98 issues will require testing they may also be tracked here. Where issues affect both they will be referred to in the description
* In general issues in other repositories should be referred to linked to avoid unecessary duplication

## Looking for Test Data?
* This repository holds intermediate releases of test data and the accompanying manual. Releases are compiled whenever a group of tests are ready and documented in the manual. Releases are then available from this repository on the [releases](https://github.com/iho-ohi/S-164-Sub-Group/releases) page. 
* This repository also contains datasets, keys, certificates and other items required for building the various test datasets. These often include "broken" catalogues and datasets, older versions and items of dubious provenance. These are all contained in the [staging](https://github.com/iho-ohi/S-164-Sub-Group/tree/main/data/Staging) folder, with appropriate warnings. **Do not attempt to use the staging datasets**
* The most up to date test Data, in the form of exchange sets, are in the working [Exchange Sets](https://github.com/iho-ohi/S-164-Sub-Group/tree/main/data/ExchangeSets) area. These can be used/tested and issues raised as appropriate. These exchange sets may be under development but represent the most up to date versions outside the bundled releases. All releases are compiled from there.
