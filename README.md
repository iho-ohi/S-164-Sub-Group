# S-164 Sub-Group

This repository contains S-00 test datasets and test dataset manual releases and development. It also contains issues related to the ongoing development of S-164 and those which relate specifically to S-98 as well.

As agreed by the group in discussions

* Issues relating to ENC content (i.e. S-101) will be tracked by the S-101 IHO repository
* Issues relating to exchange set construction for S-164, and how tests are described in S-164 are also described here
* S-98 has its own repository [here](https://github.com/iho-ohi/98-interoperability) where issues can be raised and tracked. As most S-98 issues will require testing they may also be tracked here.
* In general issues in other repositories should be referred to linked to avoid unecessary duplication
