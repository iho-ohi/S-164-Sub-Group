Radiomedical Calls 

Mariners may obtain medical advice by calling an MCTS Centre and requesting to be connected to a medical professional. The CCG will connect the vessel to an appropriate medical professional via the Marine Telephone System. 

For mariners who wish to make their own arrangements for medical advice, radiomedical services are available in numerous languages to vessels flying any flag at any location through the International Radio-medical Centre (CIRM) in Rome, Italy. This centre is staffed 24/7/365 by specially trained physicians and radio operators who also have access to specialists in all medical branches. The CIRM can be contacted via the following means:
