## S-101 edition 1.2 versions of Base, Standard and Other
No guarantees, these are converted to v1.2 by decompiling, then recompiling with the right headers etc in them. All feedback welcome. I will work with S-101 Test Datasets team to see if they want to adopt these as the current versions.?

Please raise issues on content in this repository for fixing.
