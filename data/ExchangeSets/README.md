## Datasets and Configuration files for S-164

These folders contain exchange sets in development and any associated data they require (catalogues, keys, certificates and permits). These are the most up to date exchange sets. Once particular milestones are reached, a snapshot of all the exchange sets is bundled, along with the manual into an intermediate S-164 release and posted to the [releases](https://github.com/iho-ohi/S-164-Sub-Group/tree/main/data/ExchangeSets) page.
